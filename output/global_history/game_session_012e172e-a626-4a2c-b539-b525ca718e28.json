Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

We should keep an eye on their behavior; it could be a tactic to mislead us.   player2: I agree with player1 about player3's eagerness; it does raise some red flags. We should consider focusing our attention on them and see if their behavior changes as the discussion continues.  player3: I understand the concerns about player3's behavior, but I think we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions too quickly. Deflecting attention can be a common tactic for anyone in a tense situation, not just the Werewolf. Let's observe how player3 responds to our discussions moving forward.  player4: I think the concerns about player3 are valid, but we should also consider player1's strong push against them; it could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. Let's keep an eye on player1's behavior as well, as they might be trying to manipulate the discussion.  player5: I agree that player3's eagerness to shift focus raises some concerns, but I also see merit in player4's point about player1 possibly trying to redirect suspicion. We should watch both players closely and see if their actions align with their words in the coming discussions. "
