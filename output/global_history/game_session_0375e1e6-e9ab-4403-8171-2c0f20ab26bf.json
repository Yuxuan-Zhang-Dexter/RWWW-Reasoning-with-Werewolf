Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

However, we should also consider that they might just be a Villager who feels overwhelmed. Let's keep an eye on them, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly.  player3: I understand the concerns about my quietness, but I assure everyone I'm just processing the situation. Perhaps we should also consider player1's eagerness to point fingers\u2014sometimes those who accuse others early on may have something to hide themselves.  player4: I find it interesting how player3 is defending their quietness while redirecting suspicion onto player1. This could be a tactic to deflect attention, so I believe we should keep a close watch on both player1 and player3 as we proceed. Let's gather more observations before making any decisions.  player5: I find it intriguing how both player1 and player3 are pointing fingers at each other; this could indicate tension between them. I suggest we monitor their interactions closely, as one of them may be trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves. "
