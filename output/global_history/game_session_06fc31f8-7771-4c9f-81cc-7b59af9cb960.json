Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

It might be worthwhile to keep a close watch on those who are quick to point fingers, as they could be trying to divert suspicion from the Werewolf.  player4: I think Player3's suggestion to watch those who point fingers is interesting, but it could also be a tactic to shift focus away from themselves. Let's not forget that defensiveness can be an indicator of guilt; we should keep a close eye on Player3 while also considering everyone\u2019s actions moving forward.  player5: I see valid points from everyone, but Player3's defensive stance does seem concerning. We should definitely keep an eye on them, but I agree we should also watch how others are directing the conversation\u2014those who quickly point fingers could be trying to distract us from the real threat.
