Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Let's share our observations and see if anyone's behavior stands out as suspicious.  player2: I agree with player1; we should look out for anyone who seems overly defensive. I noticed player3 has been quite quiet and hasn't contributed much; that can sometimes be a tactic to avoid suspicion. Let's keep an eye on them as we continue our discussions.  player3: I think it's important to consider that being quiet can sometimes be a strategy for both Villagers and the Werewolf. While I understand the concern about my silence, I believe we should also pay attention to anyone who is too eager to accuse others, as that might be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves.  player4: I agree with player1 and player2 about being cautious of those who are defensive or quiet. I think player3's argument about being too eager to accuse others is valid, but we should also closely observe those who try to divert attention from themselves, as that might indicate they have something to hide.  player5: I appreciate the insights shared so far. While I agree that player3's quietness is worth noting, I also find it intriguing how player2 is quick to label player3 as suspicious; this eagerness to accuse could be a tactic to divert attention. Let's keep an eye on player2 as well as player3. "
