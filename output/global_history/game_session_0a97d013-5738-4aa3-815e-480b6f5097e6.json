Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Their eagerness to accuse others does raise some red flags, and we should definitely keep a close watch on them as we figure out who the real threat might be.  player3: I understand the concerns about my eagerness, but I believe it's important to discuss everyone's behavior, not just mine. Player 1 and Player 2 seem to be very quick to jump to conclusions about me; perhaps they are trying to divert attention from their own actions. We should consider all possibilities before making a decision.  player4: I think Player 3's defensiveness is concerning; it could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. However, we should also consider if Player 1 and Player 2 are being overly aggressive in their accusations, as that can also be a sign of the Werewolf trying to create chaos.  player5: I find it interesting how Player 3 is so quick to defend themselves while also shifting blame to Player 1 and Player 2. Their defensiveness could be a sign of guilt, so I agree we should watch them closely as we discuss who to vote for. "
