Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

I'm particularly concerned about players who try to shift the focus away from themselves too quickly, as that can be a sign of guilt. Let's keep an eye on those behaviors as we continue the discussion.  player3: I agree with both of you; it's crucial to watch for anyone who seems overly defensive. I noticed player4 has been quite quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussion\u2014let's keep an eye on them as we move forward.  player4: I understand the concerns about quiet players like myself, but let's not overlook those who are too eager to point fingers. Player1 and player2 seem quite adamant in directing our attention\u2014perhaps we should consider if they're trying to deflect suspicion away from themselves.  player5: I think we should also consider the dynamics between players. While it's valid to be cautious of quiet players, player4 raises an interesting point about player1 and player2's strong focus on defense; it could be a tactic to divert attention. Let's keep an eye on how everyone contributes as we move forward. "
