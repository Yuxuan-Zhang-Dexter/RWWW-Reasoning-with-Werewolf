Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Player1 and player2 are both pointing fingers at me\u2014maybe they're trying to divert attention from themselves. Let's focus on their motivations instead.  player4: I understand the concerns about player3's quietness, but I agree with player2 that we shouldn't overlook any defensive behavior from others. Player1 and player2 seem eager to point the finger, which might suggest they\u2019re trying to distract us from themselves\u2014let's keep an eye on them as well.  player5: I find it interesting that both player1 and player2 are quick to label player3 as suspicious; it does raise some questions about their intentions. We should definitely keep an eye on all of them, but also consider if their eagerness to accuse could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. "
