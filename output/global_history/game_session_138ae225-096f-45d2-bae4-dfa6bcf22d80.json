Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

I\u2019ve noticed that player3 has been quite vague in their responses, which might suggest they have something to hide. Let's keep an eye on them.  player3: I appreciate the observations made by player1 and player2. While I understand the concern about defensiveness, I think we should also consider the possibility that someone trying to deflect attention could be attempting to protect themselves. Let's keep an eye on those who are too eager to point fingers, as that might indicate they have something to hide.  player4: I find it interesting that player2 is quick to point fingers at player3, as that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. We should watch player2 closely, as overly aggressive accusations can sometimes indicate hidden motives.  player5: I find it interesting how player2 quickly targeted player3 without much evidence, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves. We should keep a close watch on player2's behavior moving forward, as aggressive accusations can sometimes indicate hidden motives. "
