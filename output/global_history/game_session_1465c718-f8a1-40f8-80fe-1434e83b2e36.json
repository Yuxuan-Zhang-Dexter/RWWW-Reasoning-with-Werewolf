Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

It\u2019s important to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions too early; let's gather more information before deciding who to suspect.  player4: I think it's important to consider Player 1 and Player 2's eagerness to suspect Player 3; this could be a way to deflect attention from themselves. We should observe their behavior closely as we move forward to gather more insights.  player5: I see valid points from both Player 1 and Player 2 regarding Player 3's silence, but I also agree with Player 4 that we should be cautious of their eagerness to point fingers. Let's keep an eye on all players, especially those who seem defensive or overly quick to accuse others. "
