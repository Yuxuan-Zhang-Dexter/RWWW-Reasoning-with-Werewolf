Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

They seem to be quick to point fingers at me without much evidence, which could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves.  player4: I find it interesting that player3 is being defensive about their quietness; perhaps they are feeling the pressure of scrutiny. However, we should also consider why player1 and player2 are so quick to target player3\u2014could they be trying to deflect attention from themselves? Let's keep an eye on all three players.  player5: I find it curious that player3 is so defensive; it might indicate they have something to hide. However, we should also be cautious about player1 and player2's quick accusations, as they could be trying to divert attention from themselves. Let's keep our options open and observe all of their behaviors as we move forward. "
