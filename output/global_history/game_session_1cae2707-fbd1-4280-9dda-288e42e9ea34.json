Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

We should definitely keep a closer eye on them and ask direct questions to see how they respond.  player3: I find it interesting that both Player 1 and Player 2 are focusing on my silence. While I agree that being quiet can be suspicious, we should also consider that it could be a tactic to deflect attention away from themselves. Let's keep an open mind and look for more evidence before jumping to conclusions.  player4: I understand the concerns about Player 3's silence, but we should also consider the possibility that Player 1 and Player 2 are trying to steer the conversation away from themselves. It might be worth asking them both some direct questions to gauge their reactions and see if their defensiveness reveals anything more suspicious.  player5: I see valid points from everyone, but I\u2019m particularly concerned about Player 3\u2019s deflection. Their attempt to shift the focus onto Player 1 and Player 2 could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. We should ask Player 3 some direct questions to see how they respond under pressure.
