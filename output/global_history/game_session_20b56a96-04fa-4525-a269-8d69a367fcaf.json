Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

However, we should also pay attention to Player1's accusations, as they could be projecting their own intentions. Let's keep an eye on both of them moving forward.  player3: I find it interesting that Player2 is quick to deflect attention back to Player1 while expressing concerns about Player3's eagerness. It feels like they might be trying to distract us from their own potential guilt. I suggest we keep a close eye on both Player1 and Player2 as the discussion progresses.  player4: I find it interesting how Player3 is redirecting the focus back to Player2 and Player1. This back-and-forth could indicate a strategy to deflect suspicion. We should consider closely observing Player3 as their eagerness to lead may be a sign of guilt.  player5: I find it concerning how Player3 is trying to redirect suspicion towards Player2 and Player1 while avoiding accountability themselves. It might be wise for us to keep a closer eye on Player3, as their eagerness to lead could be a tactic to deflect attention from their own intentions. "
