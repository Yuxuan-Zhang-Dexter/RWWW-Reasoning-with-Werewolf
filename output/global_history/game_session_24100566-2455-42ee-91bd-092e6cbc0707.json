Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

It might be worth looking closer at their motivations and actions as we continue our discussions.  player3: I appreciate Player 1 and Player 2's observations about me, but I think it's important to remember that jumping to conclusions can cloud our judgment. Let's focus on gathering more evidence rather than getting caught up in assumptions about each other's intentions.  player4: I find it concerning how Player 3 is trying to redirect our focus on gathering evidence rather than addressing their own eagerness to point fingers. It might be wise to keep an eye on them as we continue our discussions; their defensiveness could suggest they have something to hide.  player5: I agree with the concerns raised about Player 3; their defensiveness could indeed suggest they\u2019re trying to deflect scrutiny. Let's remain vigilant and gather more observations before deciding who to vote for. "
