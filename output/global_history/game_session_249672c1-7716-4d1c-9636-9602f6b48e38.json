Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

It might be worth keeping them on our radar as we discuss who to vote for this round.  player3: I understand the concern about quiet players, but let's also consider that some might simply be processing the information. Perhaps we should focus on those who are trying to steer the conversation too aggressively, as they might be deflecting attention from themselves.  player4: I agree with the concerns about player3's quietness, but I think we should also pay attention to how player1 and player2 are aligning their thoughts; they seem to be building a case against player3 without much evidence. Let's keep an open mind and consider all players' behaviors before we jump to conclusions.  player5: I agree with the concerns about player3\u2019s quietness, but I also think we should consider how player1 and player2 are framing the discussion. Their alignment could be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves, so let\u2019s remain vigilant about all players\u2019 behaviors as we move forward. "
