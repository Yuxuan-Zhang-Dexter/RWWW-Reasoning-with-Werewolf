Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

However, I find it interesting that Player 1 and Player 2 are so quick to target me; it might be worth considering their motivations as well.  player4: I find it concerning that both Player 1 and Player 2 are so quick to target Player 3; it could suggest they are trying to divert attention from themselves. We should consider all angles before making a decision, as the real threat might be closer than we think.  player5: I find it interesting that Player 1 and Player 2 are so quick to point fingers at Player 3; their eagerness could be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves. We should consider their motivations carefully, as they might actually be trying to distract us from the real threat among us. "

We should be cautious and consider if Player 1 is attempting to protect the Werewolf while directing our attention away from their own behavior.  player5: I find it quite suspicious that Player 1 is so eager to shift the blame to Players 4 and 5.
