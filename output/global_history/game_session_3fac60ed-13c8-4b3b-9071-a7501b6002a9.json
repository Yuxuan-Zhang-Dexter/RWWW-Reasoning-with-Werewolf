Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

If anyone seems overly defensive or tries to divert the conversation away from discussing suspicions, that could be a sign of the Werewolf. Let's share our thoughts and see if we can spot any inconsistencies in each other's stories.  player2: I agree with player1; we should watch for anyone who seems overly eager to divert attention. I\u2019ve noticed player3 has been quite quiet and hasn\u2019t contributed much to the discussion, which could be a sign of them trying to blend in. What does everyone else think?  player3: I understand the concerns about quiet players, but I think we should also be cautious about jumping to conclusions too quickly. Player2\u2019s focus on my silence might be a tactic to divert attention from themselves; perhaps we should keep an eye on them as well.  player4: I see valid points being made, but I agree with player3 that we should not jump to conclusions too quickly. While player2's focus on player3's quietness is noteworthy, it might be worth considering if player2 is trying to deflect attention from themselves as well. Let's keep a close watch on both of them.  player5: I think player2's focus on player3 might be an attempt to shift suspicion away from themselves, which raises a red flag. Let's keep a close eye on both of them, but I also agree with player1's idea to look for defensive behaviors as we continue our discussions. "

Additionally, player4's cautiousness raises some flags as well, but player2's defensiveness is more pronounced, making them a prime suspect for the Werewolf. "
