Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

I noticed that player3 was quick to shift the focus away from themselves when we discussed suspicions, which could be a sign they have something to hide.  player3: I understand the concern about defensiveness, but I think we should also consider the possibility that some players might be trying to analyze the situation without drawing too much attention to themselves. Let\u2019s keep an open mind and maybe focus on how everyone is contributing to the discussion rather than just looking for defensive behavior.  player4: I think it's important to consider player3's comments more closely. Their attempt to shift the focus on analyzing contributions instead of addressing defensiveness might be a tactic to deflect suspicion. We should keep a close eye on them as we continue our discussions.  player5: I find player4's insistence on scrutinizing player3 a bit suspicious; it seems like they are trying to create a narrative against them to deflect attention from themselves. We should also consider that player1 and player2 are building a consensus too quickly\u2014could they be working together? "
