Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

However, we should also consider if anyone is trying to deflect attention away from themselves by targeting quieter players. Let\u2019s keep an eye on both Player 3 and anyone who might be overly eager to point fingers.  player3: I understand the concerns about quiet players, but I think we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions too quickly. Let's also consider that those who are too eager to point fingers, like Player 1, might be trying to divert attention from themselves.  player4: I think we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions too quickly, but Player 1's eagerness to target Player 3 does raise some suspicion. It's important to keep a balanced view and not overlook anyone who might be trying to divert attention from themselves.  player5: I agree with Player 2 that while Player 3's quietness can be concerning, we should also be wary of those who are too eager to target them. Player 1's strong focus on Player 3 might suggest they are trying to shift attention away from themselves, so we should keep a close watch on both of them. "
