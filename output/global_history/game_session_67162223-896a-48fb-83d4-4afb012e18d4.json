Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Let's gather more thoughts before we vote, but I feel some suspicion there.  player2: I see where player1 is coming from, but I think we should also consider player4. Their comments seem vague and they haven't taken a strong stance on any issue, which could indicate they're trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Let's keep an eye on them as well.  player3: I appreciate both player1 and player2's insights. While I understand the concerns about player3 and player4, I think we should also be cautious of how quickly we're jumping to conclusions; it's important to gather more information before making any decisions. Let's keep discussing and see if anyone else raises red flags.  player4: I understand the concerns raised about both player3 and player4, but I think we should take a closer look at player1's strong accusation towards player3. It might be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves. Let's keep our discussions open and see if any patterns emerge in the next few rounds.  player5: I agree with the concerns about player4 being vague; their reluctance to take a firm stance could be a strategy to blend in. Additionally, player1's strong accusation towards player3 might indeed be a deflection tactic, so we should keep both of them under close watch as we continue our discussions. "
