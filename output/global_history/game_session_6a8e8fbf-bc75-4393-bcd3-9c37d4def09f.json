Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Let's keep an eye on those who seem overly eager to shift suspicion away from themselves; that could be a sign of the Werewolf trying to blend in.  player3: I think player1 and player2 make good points about being cautious of defensive or overly eager behavior. Let's also consider how each player reacts to accusations; any inconsistencies could help us pinpoint the Werewolf among us.  player4: I find it interesting that player1 and player2 are so focused on defensive behavior; it could be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves. We should also consider player3's approach\u2014perhaps they're trying to establish themselves as a leader to steer the discussion away from their own actions.  player5: I've noticed that player4's focus on player1 and player2's comments could be an attempt to deflect suspicion away from themselves. We should keep an eye on their behavior, as it may indicate they are trying to manipulate the discussion to their advantage. "
