Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Let's keep an eye on them as we continue our discussions.  player2: I agree with player1's observation about player3; their defensiveness does raise some red flags. We should definitely keep a close watch on them and see if any further suspicious behavior emerges as we discuss.  player3: I appreciate player1 and player2's observations, but I think it's important to step back and consider that defensiveness can stem from various reasons, not just guilt. Let's keep an open mind and look for more concrete evidence as we continue our discussions.  player4: I find it interesting how quickly player1 and player2 jumped to conclusions about player3. Perhaps we should consider that they might be trying to mislead us to deflect attention from themselves. Let's be cautious and not let our suspicions cloud our judgment too early.  player5: I think we should consider player4's point about player1 and player2's quick accusations; it could indicate they are trying to deflect attention. Let's observe player3 a bit more, but also watch how player1 and player2 respond if we shift our focus away from them. "
