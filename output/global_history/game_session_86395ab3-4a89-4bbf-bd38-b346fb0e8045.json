Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

It's often the most vocal players who can mask their true intentions, so let's keep an eye on anyone who seems overly eager to point fingers.  player3: I agree with both player1 and player2. It's important to observe those who are remaining quiet, but we should also be cautious of anyone who's overly eager to lead, as they might be trying to divert our attention. Let's keep an open mind and watch for any inconsistencies in their behavior.  player4: I think we should pay attention to both the quiet players and those who are leading the discussion too aggressively. It's interesting how player1 and player2 both highlighted defensive behaviors; perhaps we should specifically watch player3, as they seem to agree with everyone without asserting any unique perspective.  player5: I find it interesting that player3 is aligning with both player1 and player2 without offering a unique perspective, which could be a sign of trying to blend in. We should definitely keep an eye on them, as well as consider whether anyone is being too vocal or trying to steer the discussion away from their own intentions. "
