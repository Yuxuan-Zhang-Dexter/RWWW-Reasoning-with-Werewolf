Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Perhaps we should look at Player 1 and Player 2's strong focus on me; it could be a tactic to shift suspicion away from themselves.  player4: I think we should take a closer look at Player 3. Their attempt to shift the focus back to Player 1 and Player 2 seems like a tactic to divert attention from themselves. We should keep an eye on them and gather more information as we discuss.  player5: I find it interesting how defensive Player 3 has become; their attempts to redirect suspicion could indicate they are trying to protect themselves.
