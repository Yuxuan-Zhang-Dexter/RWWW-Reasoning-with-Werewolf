Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

I noticed player3 seemed to shift the focus away from their actions when asked about their thoughts\u2014maybe we should keep an eye on them.  player3: I appreciate player1's and player2's observations. However, I think we should be cautious not to jump to conclusions; sometimes, players may shift focus simply because they feel pressured. Let's continue to watch how everyone interacts, as the Werewolf might try to blend in by redirecting the conversation.  player4: I see valid points from both player1 and player2 about player3's behavior. While I agree we shouldn't jump to conclusions, I think we should keep player3 on our radar, as their attempt to deflect attention could be a strategy to hide their true identity. Let's remain observant of how everyone continues to interact.  player5: I find it interesting that player2 is so quick to point out player3's behavior without considering their own actions. Perhaps we should keep an eye on player2, as their eagerness to shift suspicion might suggest they have something to hide. Let's not overlook anyone and maintain a balanced approach to our observations. "
