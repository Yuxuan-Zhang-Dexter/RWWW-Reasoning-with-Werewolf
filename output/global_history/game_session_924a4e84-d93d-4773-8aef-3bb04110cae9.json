Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

I noticed that some players seem overly defensive or eager to cast blame, which could indicate they have something to hide. Let's keep a close eye on those behaviors as we continue our discussions.  player3: I agree with both of you. I've also noticed that some players are quick to jump to conclusions, which can be a red flag. Let's keep track of those who seem overly eager to accuse others, as they might be trying to deflect suspicion from themselves.  player4: I find it interesting that everyone is quick to point out those who are overly defensive or eager to accuse. Perhaps we should also consider that those who are too focused on watching others may be trying to deflect attention from themselves. Player2's eagerness to analyze reactions feels a bit suspicious to me.  player5: I agree with the observations about players being overly defensive or eager to accuse. Player4's point about focusing on others might indicate they are trying to deflect attention, so we should keep an eye on them as well. Let's consider everyone\u2019s behavior carefully as we move forward. "
