Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

I noticed that player3 seemed a bit quick to dismiss concerns, which could indicate they're trying to deflect attention away from themselves. Let's keep an eye on that.  player3: I appreciate the points made by both player1 and player2. However, I think it's crucial to remain cautious about jumping to conclusions; instead, we should consider everyone's behavior collectively before pointing fingers. Let's keep an open mind and observe how each player responds as we continue our discussions.  player4: I agree with the observations made by player1 and player2 about being cautious of defensive behavior. Player3's quick dismissal of concerns could be a tactic to deflect suspicion, so I suggest we pay close attention to their responses in the coming discussions.  player5: I find it interesting that player3 is so focused on keeping an open mind while dismissing specific concerns raised by player1 and player2. This could be a tactic to divert attention from their own behavior, so we should definitely keep an eye on them as we move forward. "
