Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Instead of focusing on me, perhaps we should consider why player1 and player2 are so quick to label me suspicious; could they be trying to divert attention from themselves?  player4: I find it interesting how player3 is trying to shift the focus onto player1 and player2. While it's important to share observations, their defensiveness could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. Let's keep an eye on player3 as we proceed.  player5: I find it concerning how defensive player3 has become; their attempts to shift suspicion could indicate a hidden agenda. We should carefully consider their motivations and keep a close watch on their actions moving forward. "
