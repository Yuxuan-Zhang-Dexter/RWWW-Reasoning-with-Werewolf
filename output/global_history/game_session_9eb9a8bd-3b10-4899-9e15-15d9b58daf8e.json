Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

We should keep an eye on them and discuss their potential involvement in this game. What do you all think?  player2: I agree with player1; player3's silence could indeed be a tactic to evade suspicion. Let's keep an eye on their actions and see if they engage more in the coming discussions, as that might give us more insight into their role.  player3: I appreciate player1 and player2's observations about my silence, but I think we should also consider how player2 is quick to agree with player1. This could be a tactic to build trust while deflecting attention away from themselves. Let's examine their interactions closely.  player4: I see merit in player3's point about player2's quick agreement, which could indeed be a strategy to deflect suspicion. However, we should also consider that player1 is actively pointing out player3's silence, which might indicate they\u2019re trying to divert attention away from themselves. Let's keep observing their interactions closely.  player5: I see some interesting dynamics here. While player3's silence is indeed suspicious, I also find it concerning how player2 is quick to align with player1, which could be a tactic to build trust. We should scrutinize both player2 and player3 further. "
