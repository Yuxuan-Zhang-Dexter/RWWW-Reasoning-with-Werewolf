Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Perhaps we should look at player3's reactions, as they seemed a bit evasive when discussing their thoughts on the game dynamics.  player3: I appreciate player1 and player2's observations. I also noticed that player2 seemed quick to point fingers at me without much evidence; this could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. Let's keep an eye on their behavior moving forward.  player4: I find it interesting that player2 seems to be directing attention towards player3 without solid evidence. It could be a tactic to shift suspicion away from themselves, so we should remain cautious of their behavior as well. Let's keep discussing and see if any patterns emerge.  player5: I find player2's sudden focus on player3 quite suspicious; it seems like a classic tactic to deflect attention from themselves. We should carefully consider if player2 is trying to manipulate our perceptions while hiding their own identity. "

Player3's defense seems particularly strong, which might indicate they are trying to deflect attention from themselves. We should remain vigilant and examine their behaviors closely as we proceed.  player5: I find it interesting how both player1 and player3 are trying to shift blame onto each other without addressing the real issue.
