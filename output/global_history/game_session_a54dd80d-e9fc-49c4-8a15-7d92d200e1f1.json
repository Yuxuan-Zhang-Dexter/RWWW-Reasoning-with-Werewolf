Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

It's worth noting that sometimes those who shift blame might be trying to deflect attention from themselves, so let's observe their behavior closely as we continue our discussions.  player4: I find it intriguing that all three of you are highlighting defensiveness as a red flag. I think we should consider who among us has been quick to defend themselves or deflect blame; it could reveal some underlying motives. Let's keep an eye on those behaviors as we proceed.  player5: I find it curious how quickly everyone is honing in on defensiveness. Perhaps we should look at player2, who seems to echo others' sentiments without providing any unique insights\u2014this could be a tactic to blend in and avoid scrutiny. "
