Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

I\u2019ve noticed that some players might be trying too hard to steer the conversation, which could be a red flag. Let's keep an eye on those who seem overly concerned about deflecting suspicion.  player3: I find it interesting that both player1 and player2 are so focused on defensive behavior; it almost feels like they are trying to divert attention from themselves. We should also consider if they are too keen on identifying a Werewolf, as it could be a tactic to deflect suspicion away from their own actions.  player4: I agree with the observations made by player3; it\u2019s concerning how player1 and player2 are fixating on defensive behaviors. We should remain cautious of those who seem too eager to point fingers, as it might be a tactic to distract us from their own actions. Let's keep an open mind and evaluate all players equally.  player5: I find it interesting how player3 and player4 are so quick to target player1 and player2's focus on defensive behaviors. This could be a tactic to shift suspicion away from themselves. We should remain vigilant and consider all players equally, rather than fixating on just a couple of them. "
