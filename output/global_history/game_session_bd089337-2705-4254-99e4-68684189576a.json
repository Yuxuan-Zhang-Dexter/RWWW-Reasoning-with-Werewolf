      "content": "In this game of Werewolf, you will be assigned a hidden role--Villager, Werewolf, or Prophet-\u2014and must play that role throughout the game, following the specific objectives and strategies associated with it to achieve victory. Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Let's keep a close watch on both player2 and player3, as their behaviors might be more telling than they realize.  player5: I find player3's quick accusation of player2 to be a bit suspicious; it seems like an attempt to shift focus away from themselves.
