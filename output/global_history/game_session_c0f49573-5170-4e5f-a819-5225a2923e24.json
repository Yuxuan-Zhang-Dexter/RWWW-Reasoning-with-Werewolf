Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Let's keep an eye on player1 and player2; their focus on defensiveness could be a deflection tactic to distract us from their own intentions.  player4: I appreciate the points made by everyone, but I think we should also consider player3's comments about those who quickly agree with the majority. It could be beneficial to watch player1 and player2 closely, as their focus on defensiveness might indicate they're trying to deflect attention from themselves.  player5: I see merit in what player1 and player2 are saying about defensive behaviors, but we should also be wary of player3's quick agreement with the majority, as it may indicate an attempt to blend in. Perhaps we should keep a close watch on player3, as their focus on others could be a tactic to divert attention away from themselves. "
