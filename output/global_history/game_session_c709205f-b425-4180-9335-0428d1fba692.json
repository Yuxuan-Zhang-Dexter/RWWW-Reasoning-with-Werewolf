Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

We should keep an eye on them and consider if their silence might be a tactic to blend in. Who else feels suspicious?  player2: I agree with Player1 that Player3's silence is worth noting, as it can often indicate a desire to avoid scrutiny. However, we should also consider if anyone else has been overly defensive or assertive in their statements, as that can sometimes be a tactic to distract us from the real threat.  player3: I understand Player1 and Player2's concerns about my silence, but let\u2019s also consider how Player2's suggestion to look for overly defensive players could be a tactic to deflect attention away from themselves. We should watch closely for any inconsistencies in their behavior as we move forward.  player4: I think Player3's attempt to deflect attention from Player2 is worth noting, as it can indicate they're trying to protect themselves. Let's also consider whether Player2's defensive nature might be a tactic to steer us away from the real threat, so I suggest we keep a close eye on both of them as we move forward.  player5: I find Player3's deflection towards Player2 interesting, as it could indicate they are trying to shift the focus away from themselves. Additionally, Player2's insistence on looking for defensive behavior could also be a tactic to cover for their own actions, so we should keep an eye on both of them. "
