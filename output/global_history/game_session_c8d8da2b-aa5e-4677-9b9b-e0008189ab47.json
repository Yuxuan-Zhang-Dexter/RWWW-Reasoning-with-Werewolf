Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

It's crucial to analyze how everyone reacts when questioned; anyone trying too hard to deflect suspicion might be hiding something. Let's pay attention to those who seem overly quiet or overly eager to shift blame.  player3: I agree with both player1 and player2; we should definitely watch for anyone who seems overly defensive or tries to avoid the spotlight. Let's keep an eye on those who are either too quiet or too eager to shift blame, as they could be hiding something suspicious.  player4: I think it's wise to monitor those who are overly eager to point fingers, as it can sometimes indicate a desire to shift attention away from themselves. Additionally, let's pay attention to how each player reacts to pressure; subtle cues might reveal more than just their words.  player5: I find it interesting how everyone seems focused on defensive behavior. Perhaps we should also consider player3's eagerness to agree with others; over-enthusiasm can sometimes mask a hidden agenda. Let's keep a close watch on them as well. "
