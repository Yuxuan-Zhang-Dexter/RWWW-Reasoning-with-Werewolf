Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

We should keep an eye on them as we continue discussing, as defensive behavior can definitely indicate something more.  player3: I see where you both are coming from regarding my comments, but I think we should also consider how player1 and player2 are leading the discussion. It might be useful to pay attention to their reactions if we shift focus to them; sometimes the ones directing the conversation can be hiding something themselves.  player4: I think player2's focus on player3 seems a bit overzealous; they might be trying to deflect attention from themselves. We should consider if player1 and player2 are working together to steer the narrative away from their own potential guilt.  player5: I find player2's fixation on player3 to be a bit excessive and potentially a tactic to distract us from their own actions. We should keep an eye on both player1 and player2, as their leading of the conversation could indicate they are trying to manipulate our focus. "
