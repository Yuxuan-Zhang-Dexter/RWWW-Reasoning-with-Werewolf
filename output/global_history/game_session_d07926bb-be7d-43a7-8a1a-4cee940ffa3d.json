Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

We should keep a close eye on their actions as we move forward, as it may indicate they're trying to distract us from the real threat.  player3: I appreciate Player1 and Player2's observations about me, but I think we should focus on the broader picture. Instead of placing all our suspicion on one player, let\u2019s consider how everyone is contributing to the discussion; it\u2019s essential to evaluate all potential threats equally.  player4: I find Player3's attempt to redirect the focus away from themselves quite suspicious. While it's wise to assess everyone's contributions, it feels like a tactic to avoid scrutiny, so I think we should keep a close watch on them.  player5: I agree that Player3's attempts to redirect the focus seem suspicious. It's crucial we keep our eyes on them, but we should also consider if Player1 and Player2 are too eager to point fingers, as that could be a sign of trying to mislead us away from the real Werewolf.
