Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

It could be a tactic to blend in, so we should keep a close watch on their behavior as we continue our discussions.  player3: I understand the concerns about my quietness, but I think we should also consider player1's and player2's eagerness to point fingers; it might be a tactic to steer attention away from themselves. Perhaps we should focus on gathering more information before making any hasty decisions.  player4: I find it interesting that player3 is defending themselves so vigorously; it could be a sign of guilt. However, I also see player1 and player2's eagerness to point fingers as a potential red flag, so we should stay cautious and observe their behaviors closely going forward.  player5: I think we should remain cautious about player1 and player2\u2019s eagerness to point out player3. It might be a tactic to deflect attention from themselves, so let's keep a close eye on all three as we gather more information.  "
