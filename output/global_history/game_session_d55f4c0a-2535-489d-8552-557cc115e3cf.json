Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

Let's look for inconsistencies or any odd behavior that could indicate someone is hiding their true identity. What are your thoughts?  player2: I agree with player1; we should definitely watch for defensive behavior. It's important to keep an eye on anyone who seems reluctant to contribute or deflects questions about their actions. Let's make sure we encourage open discussion to draw out any inconsistencies.  player3: I see both player1 and player2 are focused on defensive behavior, which is smart, but we should also consider those who are too eager to point fingers. Perhaps player2's strong agreement with player1 is a tactic to deflect attention from themselves; let's keep an eye on them as the discussion unfolds.  player4: I think it's wise to consider both defensive behavior and those who are overly eager to point fingers. While we should be cautious of anyone trying to deflect attention, let's also keep an eye on player2, as their alignment with player1 could be a strategy to blend in while avoiding scrutiny.  player5: I agree with the emphasis on defensive behavior, but let's not overlook the potential strategy behind eagerness to point fingers. Player2's quick alignment with player1 could be a tactic to create a sense of trust, so I suggest we remain cautious and observe them closely as we continue our discussions. "
