Villagers aim to identify and eliminate the Werewolf through discussion, deduction, and voting each round, while the Werewolf works secretly to eliminate all Villagers and the Prophet without being discovered. The Prophet's role is to uncover the Werewolf by revealing one player's identity each night, using this knowledge to subtly guide the Villagers without drawing suspicion. The game progresses in rounds with Day and Night phases: during the Day, all players discuss suspicions and vote on who to eliminate, while at Night, the Werewolf secretly selects someone to kill, and the Prophet learns another player's role. Victory conditions are as follows: the Werewolf wins if they are one of only two players left, while the Villagers and Prophet win if the Werewolf is eliminated beforehand. You will be given an identity in the next message\u2014play that identity consistently, using strategic interaction and careful deduction to fulfill your role's objective. Please be concise and succinct in discussion and please just say a few sentences, one or two sentences. After getting this prompt, please reply: 'I am ready to play now!'"

We should also watch how player4 contributes\u2014if they seem too quiet or evasive, they could be hiding something important.  player4: I think it's important we consider the intentions behind our discussions. While I agree with player1 and player2 about defensiveness being a potential red flag, I also think player3's comment on their focus could indicate they are trying to steer suspicion away from themselves. Let's keep an eye on how everyone contributes moving forward.  player5: I find player3's comments about player1 and player2's focus on defensiveness to be a bit defensive themselves. It might be worth paying close attention to how player3 continues to engage in this discussion. Let's make sure we keep an eye on player4 as well, since they seem to be trying to redirect the conversation. "
