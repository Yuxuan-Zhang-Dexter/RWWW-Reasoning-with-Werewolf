Their previous attempts to deflect suspicion onto others raise red flags—let's discuss whether we believe they might be the Werewolf.\n",

Let's focus on any inconsistencies in their statements to guide our next steps.\n",

Let's keep a close watch on both player1 and player3 for any signs of manipulation.\n",
